This project is a VR basketball game. The main concept is building a basketball court as
the one shown below. The idea of having it outdoors would make the user feel more
immersed in the experience because most people did experience playing outdoors
more than indoors.

The user would have to interact with the doors of the court to open it at first. These doors can be
grabbed and rotated as normal doors and that was done by adding a hinge point to both of
them.

The user can move normally as if he is moving in real life with the joystick to not make him feel
sick or dizzy from usign teleportations.
The user has a basketball inside the court that can be grabbed and that would bounce on all
surfaces and would make a bounce sound also.

The throwing of the ball is not as in most games by pressing a button and having a certain
amount of throwing-push-forward force. The throwing force and action are basically as if you are
throwing a normal ball in real life but at the top of your hand movement would have to let the
grabbing button.
